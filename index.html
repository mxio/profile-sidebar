After my undergraduate degree, I accidentally became a freelancer - a path I've always wanted to pursue. Although I studied business and marketing in college, my managers found I had basic coding skills to manage and edit Wordpress websites. Eventually, I transitioned into web development as I built two Wordpress websites for the companies my managers own. After I graduate from Modern Developer, I hope to work on personal web development projects I am passionate about.</p>
